About Dataset

Context
We will explore a data set dedicated to the cost of treatment of different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age and so on. We have no data on the diagnosis of patients. But we have other information that can help us to make a conclusion about the health of patients and practice regression analysis. In any case, I wish you to be healthy! Let's look at our data.
